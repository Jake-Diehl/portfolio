## Overview: Transponder Mount

Designed a 3D-printed ABS mount to secure the car’s transponder to the chassis tube while aligning flush against the vehicle’s interior for precise bolt-through installation.

## Key Features

- **Tube-Mounted Design:** Engineered to clamp securely onto the chassis tubing, maintaining alignment and vibration resistance.
- **Interior Clearance:** Shaped to sit snugly against the inner body panel for accurate exterior placement.
- **Bolt-Through Interface:** Supported seamless transponder attachment with clearance and reinforcement for exterior mounting.
- **Printability:** Optimized geometry for clean ABS printing and reliable structural integrity.

## Technologies Used

- **SolidWorks:** For CAD modeling and ensuring proper fit with surrounding components. 
- **FDM 3D Printing:** For prototyping and final part production.
- **ABS Filament:** Chosen for strength, durability, and temperature resistance.

## Documentation and Learnings

Documented the full design process on Notion, including prior designs, rationale, print testing, and final outcomes. The write-up highlights lessons learned around clearance tolerancing, mount geometry, and team communication to support future contributors in this role.

## Outcome

The mount was successfully implemented and improved both the reliability and ease of transponder installation, minimizing misalignment and saving build time.

## Overview - Firewall Stencil

Designed and 3D printed a two-piece stencil to mark precise hole locations on the firewall, ensuring accurate cuts for component pass-through and mounting.

## Key Features

- **Precision Alignment:** Contoured to fit the firewall geometry and lock into place for repeatable, tool-friendly marking.
- **Two-Piece Configuration:** Interlocking design allows for printing within standard print bed size, as a single-piece print would exceed the bed’s diagonal limit.
- **Harness Protection:** The holes must be precisely positioned and cut cleanly to prevent electrical harnesses from fraying against the firewall edges, ensuring long-term reliability.
- **Reusability:** Durable construction supports multiple uses for iterative firewall adjustments.


## Technologies Used

- **SolidWorks:** Modeled for precise surface fits and part splitting.
- **FDM 3D Printing:** Used for rapid, high-resolution prototyping.
- **PLA Filament:** Chosen for dimensional stability and ease of handling.

## Challenges and Learnings

Adapting the stencil to fit the firewall’s irregular contours required iterative fit testing and refinements. The project reinforced the importance of tolerancing, ergonomic tool design, and cable protection considerations in manufacturing workflows.

## Outcome

The stencil significantly reduced layout time and error margins, improving consistency across firewall builds and ensuring clean, properly positioned holes to prevent harness tearing.
