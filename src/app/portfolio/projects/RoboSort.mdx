## Overview

Developed a semi-automated robotic system to sort golf balls by color and weight, using a combination of 3D-printed parts, Lego components, and an EV3 command brick for operation. The system aims to replace the manual sorting of golf balls, which is inefficient and costly for golf facilities. 

## Key Features

- **Automated Sorting:** The system automatically sorts golf balls by weight using an elastic band bridge and by color using a robotic arm with a color sensor. 
- **Modular Design:** The software is designed with modular functions for easier debugging and testing. 
- **Material Flexibility:** The mechanical design uses a combination of 3D-printed parts for custom components like the hopper and claw, and Lego components for structural elements and motor integration
- **Error Handling:** The software includes an unjamming sequence to address ball jams in the wheel mechanism.

## Technologies Used

- **SolidWorks:** Used for designing the hopper and other 3D-printed components.
- **Lego EV3 Command Brick:** Serves as the microcontroller to control the robot's motors and sensors. 
- **3D Printing:** Used to produce custom parts like the hopper, housing, wheel, claw, and bins using PLA filament.
- **Lego Motors and Sensors:**  Employed for movement (motors), color detection (color sensor), ball presence detection (touch sensor & color sensor), and arm rotation measurement (gyro sensor & touch sensor). 

## Documentation and Learnings

The report documents the design process, including problem statements, objectives, constraints, design changes, and testing procedures. It also details lessons learned in mechanical design, software development, and project management, with recommendations for future improvements. 

## Outcome

The RoboSort system successfully demonstrated the automated sorting of golf balls by weight and color.  The project provided a valuable hands-on experience for the team in designing, constructing, and programming a mechatronics system.
