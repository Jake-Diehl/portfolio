## Overview

Creation of "Sink It," a manually operated pinball-style basketball game constructed primarily from wood, designed as an engaging and tactile interactive experience.

## Key Features

- **Manual Plunger Mechanism**: Implemented a spring-loaded wooden plunger to manually launch a metal ball into the playfield, providing direct user control over the launch force and trajectory.
- **Themed Playfield**:  Developed a basketball-themed playfield featuring a miniature ramp leading to a hoop and backboard (scoring 100 points), along with additional lower scoring zones (10 points each, and a 0-point zone) to offer varied gameplay objectives.
- **Integrated Ball Return**: Designed the game to ensure the metal ball returns to a playable position after each launch, preventing disruption to the gameplay flow.
- **Robust Wooden Construction**: Utilized woodworking techniques including gluing, screwing, and nail gun fastening to create a durable and stable structure intended to withstand repeated use.

## Technologies Used

- **Woodworking**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Metalworking (Ramp)**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Mechanical Spring Mechanism**: Integration of a compression spring within the plunger assembly to provide the launching force for the metal ball.
- **3D Printing**: Used o produce the physical "Sink It" lettering for application to the game.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge involved balancing the desired level of difficulty with user enjoyment. The initial consideration of a bullseye target was deemed too challenging and prone to the ball leaving the game. The solution was to pivot to a basketball hoop as the primary high-value target, alongside more forgiving lower scoring zones. This iterative design process highlighted the importance of considering the user experience and making adjustments based on playability. Additionally, this project served as a significant learning experience in technical drawing (orthographics) and refining power tool skills within a woodworking context, as well as introducing the integration of 3D printing into a larger woodworking project.


## Outcome

"Sink It" successfully functions as an engaging tabletop game, providing a tactile and skill-based interactive experience. The robust construction ensures its longevity, and the basketball theme, enhanced by the 3D-printed lettering, offers a visually appealing and relatable context. This project demonstrates the successful application of woodworking, basic mechanical principles, and additive manufacturing to create a functional and enjoyable game, highlighting a commitment to quality and user-focused design.
